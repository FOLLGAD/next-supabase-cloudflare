# Next.js + tRPC Starter (Supabase + Cloudflare)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) starter with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) integration.

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Database and Authentication
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) - Deployment
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Frontend framework
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - This is an addon on top of Next.js API routes, providing fully end-to-end type-safe APIs

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use starter for building full-stack applications with Next.js, tRPC, and Supabase on the Cloudflare platform.

The range of applications that can be built with this starter is endless.

# Pages vs. Workers?

As of writing, Cloudflare Workers support for Next.js is still not mature. Thus, this project is using Pages for deployment.

It is expected that this project will be updated to use Workers in the future.
